//A disjoint-set/union-find class. Starting from a collection of sets, this data
//structure efficiently keeps track of which sets have been merged. It is
//assumed that every integer between 0 and some maximum value N is a set, so the
//data structure takes O(N) space. If only `findSet()` and `unionSet()` are
//used, then all accesses are in O(a(N)) time, where `a()` is the inverse
//Ackermann function. For all practical purposes, this is `(1). If
//`mergeAintoB()` is used then `findSet()` can have a worst-case of `O(N)`.

  //first call to this function may take `O(N)` lookups in the worst-case (less

    //equal height in which case the resultant tree is taller by 1. In essence,
